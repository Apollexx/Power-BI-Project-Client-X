# Power-BI-Project-Client-X
This project includes a data analysis report and presentation based on my created Power BI dashboard, summarizing key findings. The analysis explores sales data and distributors for client X. The repository contains a PPT and DOCX based on my created PBIX.

Questions about the data:
Q1. Who are the 10 most valuable customers for the last 2 years? How would you define most valuable?
Q2. What were the sales of the highest selling distributor in July 2021?
Q3a. What was the impact of Covid on the business? How do you define Covid breakout period? 
Q3b. Was there any specific application level 2 (product category) that was impacted more than the others?
Q4. Can you discuss over the data quality and completeness?

All Data is randomly generated and processed in Power BI.
Since PBIX file is too large, file can be provided on request.
